User Authentication

1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the User Authentication backend service.
This service will be responsible for managing user accounts, authenticating users,
and managing user authorization within the real estate application.
It will provide secure access to application resources and sensitive data.

2. Goals

Securely authenticate users based on credentials (username/password, social logins, etc.).
Protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to the system.
Provide a user-friendly and efficient authentication experience.
Integrate seamlessly with other backend services and frontend components.
Be scalable and performant to handle a large number of users.
3. User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to register for a new account using my email address and a secure password.
As a user, I want to be able to log in to the application using my credentials.
As a user, I want to be able to reset my password if I forget it.
As an administrator, I want to be able to manage user accounts, including creating, editing, and deleting them.
As a developer, I want a well-documented API for integrating user authentication with other application components.
As a user, I want the option to log in using social media accounts (e.g., Google, Facebook).
As a user, I want to be able to change my password.
As a user, I want to receive confirmation emails for registration and password reset requests.
4. Functional Requirements

Registration:
The system shall allow users to register a new account by providing the following information:
Email Address (required, unique)
Password (required, strong password enforcement - see Non-Functional Requirements)
First Name (optional)
Last Name (optional)
Phone Number (optional)
The system shall validate the email address format.
The system shall validate the password against a defined strength policy.
The system shall send a verification email to the registered email address.
The account shall not be fully activated until the user clicks on the verification link in the email.
Login:
The system shall allow users to log in using their email address and password.
The system shall authenticate users against the stored credentials.
The system shall implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
Upon successful login, the system shall generate a secure authentication token (e.g., JWT - JSON Web Token).
The authentication token shall be used for subsequent requests to authorized resources.
Password Reset:
The system shall allow users to request a password reset by providing their email address.
The system shall send a password reset link to the user's email address.
The password reset link shall expire after a defined period (e.g., 24 hours).
Upon clicking the link, the user shall be able to set a new password.
Account Management (Admin):
Administrators shall be able to create new user accounts (including setting roles).
Administrators shall be able to edit existing user accounts (including changing roles, enabling/disabling accounts).
Administrators shall be able to delete user accounts.
All administrative actions shall be logged for auditing purposes.
Social Login:
The system shall support integration with at least two social login providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).
The system shall retrieve user profile information from the social login provider (e.g., email, name).
The system shall create a new user account if one doesn't exist, or link the social login to an existing account.
Token Management:
The system shall provide a mechanism for refreshing authentication tokens before they expire.
The system shall provide a mechanism for invalidating tokens (e.g., logout).
5. Non-Functional Requirements

Security:
All passwords shall be stored securely using a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
The system shall be protected against common web vulnerabilities
(e.g., SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)).
The system shall comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
Strong password policy: minimum length, special characters, number, uppercase, lowercase letters.
Regular security audits and penetration testing shall be performed.
Performance:
The authentication process shall be fast and efficient. Login should take less than 1 second.
The system shall be able to handle a large number of concurrent users.
The system should be scalable to accommodate future growth.
